* Objective 
  This is a application which cycles through exercises providing a set 
  of visuals indicating the time of exercise that needs to be done as 
  well as the provision of a timer for action and rest periods. The 
  application will also play music during the exercises. 

* Extension objectives 
  1) Adding functionality to keep a track record of the user's 
     progress and commitment. Perhaps a calendar of some sort?

  2) Users can create their own workout plans 

  3) Implementing the application to connect to the user's 
     spotify account and access playlists.
